# Predicting-StarCraft2-rank-by-player-attributes-PySpark-
Starcraft 2 is an RTS game (real-time strategy game) that requires a lot of skills and game knowledge for one to achieve competitive success.
For this project, what I’m trying to analyze is the relationship between player attributes and their ranks, the possiblility to predict a player’s rank given some of his attributes, and how strong is the correlation between these two variables
